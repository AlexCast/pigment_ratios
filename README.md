# Pigment ratios

This repository documents available information on pigment ratios and pigment based groups within taxonomic groups, mainly to aid analysis of chemical taxonomy like CHEMTAX or BCE. It retains most of the information from source (e.g., species name, light treatment) and adds taxonomic (AphiaID) and ecological tags (e.g., habitat, ecomorphological guild). The exception is that some pigments are not included, as presented in the [data consolidation rules](https://github.com/AlexCast/pigment_ratios/wiki/Data-consolidation-rules). A qualitative version containing only presence/absence is also provided, including the sources on pigment ratios but also sources with pre-HPLC methods or providing only qualitative information. Those could be used to help assign pigment groups present to assemblage composition of field samples (microscopy, DNA, etc).

The database comprises:
* Pigment mass and molar ratios (data);
* Pigment presence / absence (data);
* Pigment molar weights and distribution among taxonomic groups (aux);
* Pigment data import, modification and consolidation (raw);
* Reference sources (anc).

Please, consider contributing to the database. This can be on the overall improvement on the rules for data consolidation, adding data to the database, suggesting references and providing original matrices of measurements. To better understand how to use the data and how to contribute to the database, please read the [user manual](https://github.com/AlexCast/pigment_ratios/wiki).
