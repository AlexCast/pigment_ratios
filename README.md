# Pigment ratios

This repository documents available information on pigment ratios and pigment based groups within taxonomic groups, mainly to aid analysis of chemical taxonomy like CHEMTAX or BCE. It retains most of the information from source (e.g., species name, light treatment) and adds taxonomical (AphiaID) and ecological tags (e.g., habitat, ecomorphological guild). The exception is that some pigments are not included, as presented in the [data consolidation rules](https://github.com/AlexCast/pigment_ratios/wiki/Data-consolidation-rules). Data is provided as molar and as mass ratios. References are provided in the anc directory. Molar weights and pigment distribution in taxonomic groups is available in the aux directory to aid the import of new datasets.

Please, consider contributing to the database. This can be on the overall improvement on the rules for data consolidation, adding data to the database, suggesting references and providing original matrices of measurements. To better understand how to use the data and how to contribute to the database, please read the [user manual](https://github.com/AlexCast/pigment_ratios/wiki).
