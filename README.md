# Pigment ratios

This repository documents available information on pigment ratios and pigment based groups within taxonomic groups, mainly to aid analysis of chemichal taxonomy like CHEMTAX or BCE.

To understand how the data is consolidated and therefore also how to contribute to the database, please read the [user manual](https://github.com/AlexCast/pigment_ratios/wiki).

## Ways to contribute:
* If you are one of the authors of the studies included and have the original full matrix of pigments, you can contact the repository manager to send your data and we will substitute the entries in the data base. This should fill in with information many pigments currently with "NA" (Not available).
* If you have an unpublished data base of pigment ratios, it is also possible to contribute. The information can be added to the database with the parameter "Published" set to "FALSE".
* If you know publication with pigment information that are not included in the database, you can add it yourself or contact the repository manager with the link of the publication.
